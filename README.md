#### Tips and what I want to test
- The inputs and outputs will be String type.
- The cases to test will be 4.
- The cases to test are:
    ```
  input: ('3♣') -> output: 'clubs'
  input: ('3♦') -> output 'diamonds'
  input: ('3♥') -> output 'hearts'
  input: ('3♠') -> output 'spades'
    ```
- I need to transform the input to the output.
